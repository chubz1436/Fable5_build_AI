# Architecture

## Overview

A deliberately small, local-first two-tier app:

```
┌─────────────────────────── browser ───────────────────────────┐
│  React 19 SPA (Vite)                                           │
│  live store: GET /api/state bootstrap + SSE entity patches     │
└───────────────┬────────────────────────────▲───────────────────┘
                │ REST (owner actions)       │ SSE /api/stream
┌───────────────▼────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┐
│  Express 5 (single process, port 4680)                         │
│                                                                │

│                   │  ▲                                         │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                data/command-center.json
```

Design principles:

1. **One source of truth** — `shared/types.ts` is imported by server and
   client; there is no duplicated model.
2. **The engine owns state** — adapters *report*, the engine *decides*.
   Every task transition goes through the lifecycle state machine
   (`domain/lifecycle.ts`); illegal jumps are 409s, in tests and in the UI.
3. **Everything explainable** — routing scores carry factor strings, risk
   levels carry rationales, approvals carry recommendations with reasons.
4. **Local and safe by default** — no network calls, no credentials, no
   writes outside the data file.

## Technology choices

| Concern      | Choice                              | Why                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Language     | TypeScript everywhere (strict)      | one model shared across tiers                              |
| Backend      | Express 5 + tsx                     | tiny, no build step for the server                         |
| Realtime     | Server-Sent Events                  | one-directional updates, auto-reconnect, no ws dependency  |
| Persistence  | single JSON doc, atomic tmp+rename  | zero native deps, human-inspectable, adequate for 1 owner  |
| Frontend     | React 19 + Vite + hand-rolled CSS   | fast, no UI-kit lock-in, full control of the ops aesthetic |
| State (UI)   | useReducer store fed by SSE         | the server is the store; the client just mirrors it        |
| Tests        | Vitest + supertest                  | unit + real-HTTP integration in one runner                 |

## Data model

Entities (see `shared/types.ts` for the full definitions):

- **Project** — grouping + accent color + tags.
- **Task** — goal (original NL request), title, project, status, risk,
  priority, scope, tags, acceptance criteria, assigned worker,
  recommendation (with per-worker scores), attempts, progress, phase,
  runPlan (step checklist), blockReason, evidence, handoffIds, timestamps.
- **WorkerProfile** — name/role/provider/model/avatar, strengths (skill
  tags), traits (careful/fast/local/…), availability, health, currentTaskId,
  adapter kind, `integration: 'simulated' | 'planned'` (honesty flag),
  completedTaskCount.
- **Approval** — type `start | midrun | completion`, what-will-happen
  description, risk, affected scope, recommended action + reason, status,
  decision note.
- **Handoff** — from/to worker + structured context: goal, current state,
  completed work, remaining work, files in scope, evidence notes, risks,
  exact next action.
- **EventRecord** — append-only audit log; types like `task.created`,
  `worker.recommended`, `approval.requested`, `run.started`, `run.log`,
  `run.phase`, `run.blocked`, `handoff.created`, `verify.passed`,
  `review.ready`, `task.completed`. The UI renders milestones as the
  timeline and `run.log`/`run.phase` as the live console.
- **Evidence** — request, summary, work performed, files changed (+diff
  stats), test report, log tail, limitations, confidence, final owner action.

## Task lifecycle

```
backlog → ready → awaiting_approval → running → verifying → review → completed
                       ↑                │  ↑                   │
                       │            paused  │                   │ changes requested
                       │ rejected       │  │                   ▼
                       └────────────    └→ blocked ←───────────┘
                                            │ retry / reassign → running
cancelled: reachable from every non-terminal state
```

- `awaiting_approval` — a **start approval** is pending.
- `running` may pause itself while a **mid-run approval** is pending (the
  adapter awaits the owner's decision; status stays `running`, phase =
  "Waiting for owner approval").
- `verifying` — post-run checks (types/tests/criteria); produces evidence.
- `review` — a **completion approval** is pending; approve ⇒ `completed`,
  reject ⇒ `blocked` ("owner requested changes") so retry machinery reuses
  the same path.
- On boot, tasks found `running/verifying/paused` (a crash or restart
  happened mid-run) become `blocked` with a clear reason; stale worker
  states are cleared and orphaned mid-run approvals expire. Retry resumes.

## Worker adapters

`server/src/engine/adapters/types.ts` defines the seam:

```ts
interface WorkerAdapter {
  start(ctx: RunContext): void;   // translate task+handoff → tool execution
  pause(taskId): void;
  resume(taskId): void;
  cancel(taskId): void;           // stop silently; engine records events
}
```

`RunContext` is the only capability an adapter gets: `log`, `phase`,
`progress`, `plan`, `stepDone`, `requestApproval() → Promise<boolean>`,
`blocked(reason)`, `finished(result)`. The engine implements it, stamps every
emission with a run token so cancelled/superseded runs can't mutate state,
and owns all persistence and eventing.

### Today: `SimulatedAdapter`

Deterministically seeded per `(taskId, attempt)`. Builds a realistic step
plan from the task's tags, paces steps by `SIM_SPEED`, honors pause/cancel
between (and during) steps, and follows documented scenario rules:

- risk `high` → requests a mid-run owner approval before the guarded step
  (skipped on later attempts if already granted once);
- attempt 1 of `medium`/`high` risk → one realistic blocker (failing tests,
  dependency conflict, or workspace drift) — retry or reassignment succeeds;
- produces evidence artifacts (files + diff stats, test report, limitations,
  confidence) that are **labeled as simulated** in the delivery.

### Real: `ClaudeCodeAdapter` and `CodexAdapter`

Two real adapters drive locally installed coding CLIs. They share
provider-agnostic machinery in `adapters/cli-common.ts` (workspace
snapshot + real diff, task brief, final-report extraction, process
tree-kill, CLI detection); each adapter adds only its own launch flags and
stream parsing.

At boot, `enableRealAdapters()` (called only from the runtime entrypoint,
never in tests) probes each CLI via `detectCli` — which retries a few times
so a transient spawn failure under load doesn't misread an installed CLI as
missing — and upgrades the matching worker (`wkr_claude_code` → `claude-code`,
`wkr_codex` → `codex`), or reverts it to simulated (restoring its model
label) with an event when the CLI is genuinely absent.

**`ClaudeCodeAdapter`** (`adapters/claude-code.ts`) drives the Claude Code
CLI.

Per run it: creates an isolated workspace under `data/workspaces/<taskId>/`,
writes a `_TASK_BRIEF.md` (goal, criteria, retry note, handoff context,
rules), pipes the prompt over **stdin** to `claude -p --output-format
stream-json --verbose --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools
Write,Edit,Read,Glob,Grep` (file tools only — no Bash, no network), parses
the stream-json events into live `ctx.log`/`ctx.progress` updates, and on
success diffs before/after workspace snapshots so `filesChanged` reflects
what actually happened on disk. The model's own self-report (a fenced JSON
block in its final message) supplies only summary/limitations/confidence.
Failures (not logged in, non-zero exit, timeout) map to `ctx.blocked` with
the real error; cancel kills the process tree.

**`CodexAdapter`** (`adapters/codex.ts`) drives `codex exec --json` with
`--sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check -C <workspace> -o
<lastMsgFile>`, the prompt piped over stdin. Unlike Claude Code (file tools
only), Codex may run shell commands inside the sandbox — so it can execute
the code it writes — while writes stay confined to the workspace. Its
stream-json parser is intentionally defensive (correctness comes from the
exit code, the `-o` final-message file, and the workspace diff, never from
guessing the exact event schema), and nested Codex error shapes are
flattened to a readable message. An optional `CODEX_MODEL` selects the model
when the account default is unsuitable.

**`AntigravityAdapter`** (`adapters/antigravity.ts`) drives the Antigravity
CLI (`agy --print`), which returns a PLAIN-TEXT response (no JSON stream), so
the adapter streams stdout lines straight into the log and reads the fenced
json report from the accumulated text. `agy` cannot edit files in headless
mode unless permissions are auto-approved, so the adapter runs `--sandbox`
(terminal restrictions) **plus** `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, confined
to the workspace via cwd + `--add-dir`. This is broader than the file-only
Claude Code adapter; it is gated by the owner's start-approval and is
disableable via `ANTIGRAVITY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=0` (runs then block with an
actionable message instead of silently doing nothing). The full brief is
written to `_TASK_BRIEF.md` and referenced by a short, fixed prompt so no
task text is interpolated into the shell command line.

Honesty guarantees (all real adapters): `RunResult.checks` may contain only
checks that actually ran, and `criteriaMet: null` leaves acceptance criteria
unjudged so the delivery review tells the owner to inspect the files. Real
processes can't be paused portably, so the adapters declare
`capabilities.pause = false` and the engine refuses pause requests with a
clear message.

Requirements: one-time login by the owner (`claude /login`, `codex login`,
Antigravity app login). Only **Hermes** remains simulated (no local CLI);
adding a real adapter for it (a local model over HTTP) follows the same
recipe — nothing in the engine, API, store, or UI changes.

## API surface

```
GET  /api/state                      full snapshot (bootstrap)
GET  /api/stream                     SSE: task/worker/approval/handoff/event patches
POST /api/tasks/parse                NL text → structured TaskDraft (no side effects)
POST /api/tasks                      create task from (edited) draft → status ready
GET  /api/tasks/:id                  task + its events/approvals/handoffs
POST /api/tasks/:id/promote          backlog → ready
POST /api/tasks/:id/request-start    assign worker (or recommended) → start approval
POST /api/tasks/:id/pause|resume|cancel|retry
POST /api/tasks/:id/reassign         {workerId, reason} → structured handoff → run
POST /api/approvals/:id/decision     {decision: approve|reject, note?}
GET  /api/health
```

Domain errors carry status codes (400 intake, 404 not found, 409 lifecycle);
the JSON error body is surfaced verbatim in the UI.

## Persistence

**SQLite (WAL) is the single authoritative store** (`server/src/db/db.ts`,
Node's built-in `node:sqlite` — zero native dependencies). Domain entities
are JSON documents with constraint-relevant columns lifted out; operational
tables (attempts, operations, leases) are fully typed with UNIQUE and
partial-index guarantees. Foreign keys are on; an integrity check runs at
boot; every state transition that must be atomic runs in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
transactions; events are an append-oriented log with a bounded tail. A
legacy v0.2 `command-center.json` is imported once (never modified or
deleted). The `Store` facade keeps the repository-shaped surface
(`task(id)`, `upsertTask`, `eventsForTask`, …) and still broadcasts every
mutation to SSE subscribers.

## Security boundaries

- Binds to localhost; single owner; no auth by design.
- No secrets, tokens, or external endpoints anywhere.
- Simulated execution cannot write files; the only disk artifact is the data
  file. Real adapters must keep the isolated-workspace + approval-gate
  contract described above.
- The UI never executes worker-provided content; logs are rendered as text.

```

Key modules: `db/db.ts` (SQLite WAL + migrations + legacy import),
`git/git.ts` (execFile-only plumbing; EVERY call forces an empty `core.hooksPath`,
`diff.external=`, `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv`, no-fsmonitor, and a
non-interactive/no-network git env), `git/projects.ts` (registry + sanitizers),
`attempts/service.ts` (grants, leases, pipeline, recovery, cleanup, routing),
`attempts/runners.ts` (TestRunner + hardened CodexRunner + redaction + safe
spawning), `attempts/env.ts` (allowlisted child environments — validator and
worker), `attempts/validator.ts` (independent checks + fail-closed per-command
containment guard), `attempts/integrity.ts` (pre-execution git baseline +
tamper verification + fail-closed symlink/junction escape scan),
`security/auth.ts` (token + origin + headers). Attempt states:
`creating_worktree → running → validating → ready_for_review →
accepted|rejected`, plus `cancelling | cancelled | failed | timeout |
unknown_outcome | blocked_reconciliation`. Every consequential step is an
Operation row with a unique idempotency key; leases live behind partial
unique indexes so duplicate dispatch and overlapping executions are
impossible at the database level. Start approvals persist their full
ExecutionSpec and its hash; completion approvals are bound to the final
evidence hash + checkpoint commit and are invalidated/replaced by any
worktree change or re-validation. Store broadcasts are buffered inside
transactions and published only after COMMIT. Acceptance never merges or
pushes; worktree cleanup refuses to destroy work that lacks a verified
durable checkpoint (unless the owner explicitly confirms discard) and always
keeps the attempt branch.
